‘Method of Manufacture
Faris! described 2 method of manufacture for 2-amino-4-
raivophenal by the paral reduction of 2-ntrophenol by
lnydromulfide, hydrazine, or copper. Eletolytic eduction may
be done wsing vanadium.

‘The preparation of 2-amino-S-nitrophenol involves exts-
lytic reduction of2-itrphenal with Raney Ni, ring closure
with acetic anhydride to give 2-methylberzoxa7ol, nitration
{in mixed HINO;-H,S0y, and subsequent lidoysis wth HCI

4-Amino-2-irophenol canbe produced by I of 4 methods
(1) reduction of hydroxy nitoszabenzene-4-sulfonie acid
With iodine and sulfurous acid, (2) seduction of 4chlro-¥-
nitro-4"hydkoxyaobenzene3-culfnic acid wih Hand ced

‘4-Hydroxypropylamine-3-nitopbenol was negative in all
genotoxicity tests reported inthis safety assesment.

‘There was an increased incidence of acinar el adenomas of
te pancreas in male rats that oeeived 100 mg/kg 2-amino-5-
nitrophenl. The significance ofthe acinat eel adenomas of the
panereas was confounded by the use of com oil ts vehicle that,
hs been showe to promote these tumors inthe strain of rats
‘used in the study. Tere was no evidence of carcinogenic activ-
lity for female ats receiving 100 or 200 mg/kg amin.
ritrpenol. In another stay, it was found that there ws no
evidence of carcinogenic aciviy in mies receiving a dose of
400 mz 2-amino-Sitrophenol, and given the reduced su
vival rate ofboth sexes at 800 mk the numberof animals
‘wat inadequate to detect a carcinogenic response

When 4amino-2-aitrophenol was fed to rats in concenta-
‘ions of 1250 and 2500 ppm, high-dose mals were found to
have either transitional cell carcinoma, transitional-cell papi
toma, or ransitona-el hyperplasia. No tumors ofthe bladder
‘were found amoag 220 male and 220 frst historcal-contrl
‘is. Other tumors that occurred in high-doe rats but natin the
controls were epidermoid careinoma of the salivary gland,
fibrosarcoms,osteosrcoms, and chondrosarcoma. It Was cot
‘cluded tht under this bioassay, 4-amino-?-nitvophenol was
‘carcinogenic for male Fischer 344 rats, including trsitional-
cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder; the wanstonl-cell
‘areinomss of the urinary bladder observed in 3 ded female
rats may have been associated with adminisvation of the
‘amino-2-nitrophenol. When the same study was conducted
with mice instead of rts, it was concluded that under this
Dicasay, 4-amino-2-itrophenol was not exrinogenie for the
‘male and female mie tested at 1250 and 2500 ppm.

2 separate studies, mise were treated dermally with 4-
amino-2-nitropbeaol In bth studies, all ofthe mice (even con
‘wo groups) developed Iymphotd tumors. However, inthe rst
study, it was discovered thatthe mice weted with he chemical
‘developed the tumors earlier 38th week) than the control mie
(75th week). Also in the second study i wat found that the
female mice had an increase in female reproductive tumors,
‘whereas the contol groups dd not.

4-Amino3-itropenel ina har dye application was reported
to have caused erythema and edema in cate sty of 42-
yearold woman. Another case study described a 50-year-old
‘woman who developed scalp demais severe itching ofthe
face, neck, and upper tore: snd vesicular hand eczema I day
after using @nonpermanent has dye tat contained 3-nitro-p-
hydroxyethyaminophenol and 4-amio-3-irophena

Available air dye epidemiology studies are insufficient to
‘conclude a causal lationship between bai dye use and cancer
or oter diseases.

Discussion
(Overall the availabe toxicity studies for these amino itrophe-
ol hat dyes do not suggest safery concerns except for the
potential carcinogenicity of 4-amino-?-nitophenol Early
‘onset of lymphoid tumors in mice ad the increased incidence
‘of transtiona-cel! carcinoma in rat bladders were noted. Ia
ukdtion, 4amino-2-aitophenol is genotoxic in Ames tet,
Rauscher leukemia virus-infected rat embryo assay, and
LSI78Y mouse iymphoma cell mutation assays. The panel
noted the absence of reproductive and developmental toxicity
‘ata regarding. 4amino-2-nitophenol. It may be tht the
effects noted are related tothe presence ofan impurity. It also
‘nay be that there is 50 litle dermal penetration tht ese
effects are not relied ueder use conditions.

For the Expet Panel to reach & conclusion for 4mino-2-
itrphenel adlitional data ae needed that describe any ipa
‘ties and peroutaneous absorption fr this ingredient under
conditions used in cosmetic applications. If ther is significant
éenmal absorption, dermal reproductive and. developmental
toxicity at may be needed.

Increased incidences of pancreatic acinar cell adenomas
were seen in male rats treated with 2-aminoS-irophens
However, there were no incidenoes of acinar eel adenomas
in feral ats orn a similar study with mice. The panel noted
that com ol was used asa vehicle nthe std with 2-mino-S-
nitrphenol This vehicle has been shown to promote the types
‘of tumors found in mae rts ofthe strain sod in the NTP stay.
[No adverse reproductive or developmental effets were noted
for this ingredient.

‘Reproductive and developmental stues forthe remaining
Ingredient inthis group didnot indicate toxic.

‘The Expert Panel recognizes that 2-amino--nitrophenl,
2amino--titophenal, 2amine-S-tropheno, mine 2a.
‘enol, 4-ain0-}-ntrophena,2-mino-4nivopheaol slate,
3 nito-p-hydroxyethylaminaphesol, and. 4-hydroxypropyl

that following thie procedure will identify prospective ind-
viduals who would bave an iitaion/senstzation reaction

Conclusion

‘Based onthe data contained inthis report the CIR Expect Pane!
‘concludes that 2-amino-3-iophenol, 2-amino-4-nicophenol,

Sitropbenol, 3-nitro-p-hydroxyethylamiophenol, and. 4-
ydroxypropylamino-S-nirophenol are safe as hair dye
ingredients in the practices of use and concentration as
escribed in this safety assesment, but the data are insu
